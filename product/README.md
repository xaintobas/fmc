This is my solution to the Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After completing this challenge, I have some ideas on using Flexbox.
I also learned the justify-content and align-items properties and how they really function.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would want to focus more on building advanced layouts using flex box. Sometimes I still make some mistakes with some of the CSS properties that goes with flexbox.
